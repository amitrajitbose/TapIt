##### Description
Hi There!
This repository contains implementation for a simple, clean, interactive, single page, uni-player web application game. We used technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery for developing the platform. The UI has been intentionally kept minimalistic, bright and colorful which is also quite similar to the [website](https://localhackday.mlh.io/) theme of the event host for the hackathon.
We enjoyed building this funny and hopefully addictive game. We would love to hear back from you regarding any comments, suggestions or feedbacks.
